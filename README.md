🎨 Virtual Art Gallery – HTML Project
📌 Project Overview

The Virtual Art Gallery is a simple static website created using only HTML5.
It showcases five artworks, along with their descriptions, comparisons, and additional details. The project is designed to practice HTML fundamentals like headings, paragraphs, images, lists, tables, hyperlinks, and text formatting—without using CSS or JavaScript.

🛠 Features Implemented

✅ HTML Boilerplate with <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <title>, <body>

✅ Headings & Paragraphs: Title of gallery and descriptions for each artwork

✅ Comments: Added for better documentation of code sections

✅ Text Formatting: Bold (<b>), Italic (<i>), Underline (<u>), Strikethrough (<del>)

✅ Horizontal Rule & Line Breaks: <hr> and <br> used for separation and formatting

✅ Hyperlinks:

Internal links to jump to artworks

External link to art resources

✅ Images: At least 5 artworks with alt, width, and height attributes

✅ Lists:

Ordered list (gallery rules / steps to create art)

Unordered list (materials / techniques) with <li value=""> and type attributes

✅ Table: Compared artworks with columns (Artwork | Medium | Year)

✅ Footer: Copyright + Contact
